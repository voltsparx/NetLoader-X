NetLoader-X Terminology
======================

Tick
  One simulation step (usually 1 second). Each tick produces one snapshot
  in the exported metrics and reports.

Snapshot
  A dictionary of simulated metrics captured at a tick (queue depth, latency,
  error rate, etc.).

Virtual clients / Threads
  An abstract knob controlling simulated demand. These are NOT real network
  connections and NOT a real traffic generator.

Event
  A simulated request arrival. Events are numbers used to drive the model.

Generated events
  Events produced by the scheduler/pattern for a tick.

Dropped events
  Events capped by safety limiters and not injected into the model.

Retry events
  Extra events added to simulate client retries when the simulated error rate
  increases (retry amplification behavior).

RPS (requests_per_second)
  Simulated throughput, computed from completed work divided by tick duration.

Latency (latency_ms)
  Simulated response time in milliseconds.

Error rate (error_rate)
  Simulated fraction of events that fail (0.0 to 1.0). Reports may show this
  as a percent.

Queue depth (queue_depth)
  Simulated backlog waiting to be processed.

Queue limit
  Maximum queue depth before simulated rejections happen.

CPU pressure (cpu_pressure)
  Synthetic saturation indicator (0.0 to 1.0).

Degraded
  A tick where the model considers the service under stress (high pressure
  or high queue). Expect latency and errors to rise.

Crashed
  A tick where the model considers the service down. Error rate is forced to
  100% until recovery conditions are met.

Slow clients (slow_workers / slow_clients)
  Simulated long-lived pressure that occupies capacity for longer.

Attack profile
  A predefined demand behavior used by the engine:
  HTTP, BURST, SLOW, WAVE, RETRY, CACHE, MIXED.

Scheduler
  How demand changes over time (ramp, wave, burst, stair-step, etc.).

Chaos / Fault injection
  Random perturbations applied during a run (latency spikes, higher error rate,
  reduced capacity). Still fully offline and simulated.

Cluster mode
  A multi-backend simulation with a load balancer, backend servers, and a
  database/cache layer.

Report
  Exported artifacts under outputs/... including metrics.json/csv/html and
  summary.txt.

Safety caps
  Hard limits in core/config.py that keep the framework defensive and
  non-networked.
